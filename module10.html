 <h1>Module 10</h1>
  <p> In my design I really tried to make the content as simple to find and easy as possible. My presentation is meant to leave a lot of space that can be used for information or portfolio pieces. There are obviously things I could have done better, and as this is my first experience using the majority of these programs (Photoshop, text editors, etc) there is still room to grow and much to learn about making websites look clean and concise.</p>
  <p> I wanted to keep my code simple because I did not want to end up with a convoluted mess that one little slip up could break. It is a bit daunting to start from a blank white page and have to come up with the framework, content, and design. It is even more daunting to actually have to apply it and execute your design well. When I was working on my design docs I really had no idea what I was doing or how to make what was in my mind's eye a reality. So I tried to make a nice couple of more complicated things such as my nav bar or divs on the page that would do what they need to do without being too difficult or overcomplicated.</p>
  <p> My main shortcoming would probably be that I could have done more than I did. As stated before I was a bit scared to jump in over my head and end up with something that looked terrible and that I could not fix. I wish I had given myself a bit more time to study up and find techniques that would have worked for what I wanted to do. However, this does give a nice basis for next time and I will know how to make a website similar to what I already have and by making it cleaner/clearer I will be able to upgrade my design much more easily.</p>
