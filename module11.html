 <h1>Module 10</h1>
 <p> The scrum team was a bit of an interesting experiece for me. I did not really communicate with the people in this class more than a couple of times for group projects or revision processes. Given this, it was little bit hard to show my work and to be shown others. I felt like I was put into a group of people who already knew eachother pretty well and had been sharing the entire time so it was kind of hard for me to relate and feel comfortable showing them my work and such. Given all of that I still think it was helful to see what everybody else had been doing and what their thought processes were. I learned a lot just from looking at their work and seeing how they were going about building their website. One of the biggest things that helped me was seeing that many of the people were using Codepen to see what they were creating in real time. One of the things that frustrated me in the design process was having to either constantly save and update to see my work or to try and picture everything mentally and hope that it worked out for the best. Codepen was an indispensable tool and I do not know if I could have created my website without being able to use it. Being able to save things and try them out plus using CTRL Z to quickly go back to where you were was great and I'm thankful for the SCRUM showing me ways to use it effectively.</p>
 
 <p> To be honest I had a hard time working in class, especially for the first couple of months because at that time I did not have a laptop. Working on the school computers just did not really work for me so I had to try and keep everything in my head until I was able to get home and go to work on my desktop. Once I got the laptop and Photoshop my productivity went up tenfold. Most of the work ended up being done at home but I could now work in class when my ideas and the teachings were fresh.</p>
 
 <p>I was able to get support for my project mostly from google and from my dad. My father is a technical writer and works with lots of tag-based programming languages like XML. If I had basic questions or wanted to get his opinion I could just show him online what I had so far and see what he thought. In terms of actually completing work and getting the projects done and coded, google and youtube were great helps. Youtube was the only way I ever would have figured out the basics of Photoshop to create my design documents and google solved almost all of my HTML/CSS related questions. I was able to look up hex codes, regular codes, or really anything else that could have been helpful to me.</p>
